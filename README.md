Languages used:
HTML

Technologies utilized:

Express
EJS

CSS Framework utilized:
Materialize was utilized to align content as well as style edit and delete buttons.


CRUD 
Created 7 RESTful routes:
index
show
new
edit
create
update
delete

Approach Taken:
Started with wireframing- initially wanted to include separate pages for dog and cat toys but decided to simplify and keep all-inclusive pet toys on one page instead. 
Had a general idea of how I wanted the user-flow to feel, and as I build each route, that flow became more clear.
I got the site to work pretty well over all and I would have liked to add more styling as well as more seed data. In the mean time I added extra data manually through the site. I am happy with my result!
